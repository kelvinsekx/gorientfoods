            <div>
                <p>The mission of every organization is to make profit and our company is not left out. At the same time, it will create avenue for others (distributor and other middlemen) to make profit, create employment opportunity for the teeming populace, and utilize our yam tuber, thereby patronizing our local farmers and increasing their turnover to produce a product of high quality at a lower price that everyone will be able to afford and be willing to buy.</p>

            <h2>objective</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The primary objective is to put smile on people's face especially our mothers who go through the rigor of pounding the yam whenever they think of eating pounded yam. We want to greatly bridge the stress they will pass through in preparing pounded yam - a meal that cuts across the country as a special dish, which make them avoid this desired meal.</p>
